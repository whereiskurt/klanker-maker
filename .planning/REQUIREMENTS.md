# Requirements: Klanker Maker

**Defined:** 2026-03-21
**Core Value:** A sandbox is a declarative policy object that compiles into a controlled, auditable execution environment

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for initial release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Schema & Validation

- [x] **SCHM-01**: Operator can define a SandboxProfile in YAML with apiVersion, kind, metadata, spec sections
- [x] **SCHM-02**: Schema supports lifecycle, runtime, execution, sourceAccess, network, identity, sidecars, observability, policy, and agent sections
- [x] **SCHM-03**: Operator can run `km validate <profile.yaml>` and get clear error messages for invalid profiles
- [x] **SCHM-04**: Profile can extend a base profile via `extends` field, inheriting and overriding specific sections (code exists, needs verification — Phase 7) (verified Phase 7 — inherit_test.go passes)
- [x] **SCHM-05**: Four built-in profiles ship with Klanker Maker: open-dev, restricted-dev, hardened, sealed (code exists, needs verification — Phase 7) (verified Phase 7 — builtins_test.go passes)

### Provisioning & Lifecycle

- [x] **PROV-01**: Operator can run `km create <profile>` to compile profile into Terragrunt inputs and provision EC2 + VPC + IAM
- [x] **PROV-02**: Operator can run `km destroy <sandbox-id>` to cleanly tear down all sandbox resources
- [x] **PROV-03**: Operator can run `km list` to see all running sandboxes with status
- [x] **PROV-04**: Operator can run `km status <sandbox-id>` to see detailed sandbox state
- [x] **PROV-05**: Sandbox auto-destroys after TTL expires
- [x] **PROV-06**: Sandbox auto-destroys after idle timeout with no activity
- [x] **PROV-07**: Sandbox teardown policy is configurable (destroy/stop/retain)
- [x] **PROV-08**: Every sandbox resource is tagged with `km:sandbox-id` for tracking and cost attribution
- [x] **PROV-09**: Operator can specify substrate (`ec2` or `ecs`) in the profile's `runtime.substrate` field and `km create` provisions the corresponding infrastructure
- [x] **PROV-10**: ECS substrate provisions an AWS Fargate task with sidecar containers for enforcement (DNS proxy, HTTP proxy, audit log) defined in the task definition
- [x] **PROV-11**: EC2 sandboxes use spot instances by default; on-demand fallback is configurable per profile
- [x] **PROV-12**: ECS sandboxes use Fargate Spot capacity provider by default; on-demand fallback is configurable per profile
- [x] **PROV-13**: Sandbox handles spot interruption gracefully — uploads artifacts to S3 before termination when possible

### Network & Security

- [x] **NETW-01**: Security Groups enforce egress restrictions as the primary enforcement layer
- [x] **NETW-02**: DNS proxy sidecar filters outbound DNS by allowlisted suffixes (works on both EC2 and ECS substrates)
- [x] **NETW-03**: HTTP proxy sidecar filters outbound HTTP/S by allowlisted hosts and methods (works on both EC2 and ECS substrates)
- [x] **NETW-04**: IAM role is session-scoped with configurable duration and region lock
- [x] **NETW-05**: IMDSv2 is enforced (http-tokens=required) on all sandbox EC2 instances
- [x] **NETW-06**: Secrets are injected via SSM Parameter Store with allowlist of permitted secret refs
- [x] **NETW-07**: SOPS encrypts secrets at rest with KMS keys provisioned as part of Klanker Maker infrastructure
- [x] **NETW-08**: GitHub source access controls allowlist repos, refs, and permissions (clone/fetch/push)

### Observability & Artifacts

- [x] **OBSV-01**: Audit log sidecar captures command execution logs (works on both EC2 and ECS substrates)
- [x] **OBSV-02**: Audit log sidecar captures network traffic logs (works on both EC2 and ECS substrates)
- [x] **OBSV-03**: Log destination is configurable (CloudWatch/S3/stdout)
- [x] **OBSV-04**: Filesystem policy enforces writable and read-only paths
- [x] **OBSV-05**: Artifacts upload to S3 on sandbox exit with configurable size limits
- [x] **OBSV-06**: S3 artifact storage supports multi-region replication
- [x] **OBSV-07**: Secret patterns are redacted from audit logs before storage
- [x] **OBSV-08**: Tracing sidecar collects OpenTelemetry traces and spans from sandbox workloads and exports to a configurable OTel collector endpoint
- [x] **OBSV-09**: Each sandbox session is logged as an MLflow run with sandbox metadata (profile, sandbox-id, duration, exit status) as run parameters
- [x] **OBSV-10**: OTel trace context is propagated through proxy sidecars so outbound HTTP requests carry trace headers

### Email & Communication

- [x] **MAIL-01**: SES is configured globally with Route53 domain verification
- [x] **MAIL-02**: Each sandbox agent gets its own email address (agent-id@domain)
- [x] **MAIL-03**: Agents inside sandboxes can send email via SES
- [x] **MAIL-04**: Operator receives email notifications for sandbox lifecycle events (expiry, errors, limits)
- [x] **MAIL-05**: Cross-account agent orchestration is possible via email

### Infrastructure Foundation

- [x] **INFR-01**: AWS multi-account setup: management account, terraform account, application account (defcon.run.34 pattern)
- [x] **INFR-02**: AWS SSO configured for operator access across accounts
- [x] **INFR-03**: Route53 hosted zone configured in management account, delegated to application account
- [x] **INFR-04**: KMS keys provisioned for SOPS encryption
- [x] **INFR-05**: S3 buckets for artifacts with lifecycle policies and cross-region replication
- [x] **INFR-06**: Terragrunt per-sandbox directory isolation (no workspace sharing)
- [x] **INFR-07**: Domain registered in management account and connected to application account
- [x] **INFR-08**: All infrastructure modules and application code from defcon.run.34 (Terraform modules: network, ec2spot, ecs-cluster, ecs-task, ecs-service, secrets; Terragrunt patterns: site.hcl, service.hcl; Go application: apps/local/configui/) are copied into the Klanker Maker repo, renamed, and adapted — no runtime or build-time dependency on defcon.run.34 exists

### ConfigUI — REMOVED 2026-06-02 (web dashboard was unused; `cmd/configui` deleted)

- [~] ~~**CFUI-01**: Web-based profile editor for creating/editing SandboxProfile YAML~~ (removed)
- [~] ~~**CFUI-02**: Live sandbox status dashboard showing running sandboxes~~ (removed)
- [~] ~~**CFUI-03**: AWS resource discovery showing what each sandbox provisioned~~ (removed)
- [~] ~~**CFUI-04**: SOPS secrets management UI for encrypt/decrypt operations~~ (removed)

### Platform Configuration

- [x] **CONF-01**: All platform-specific values (domain name, AWS account IDs, SSO start URL, region preferences) are defined in a single configuration file (e.g. `km-config.yaml` or `.klankermaker.yaml`) — operators checking out the repo set their own values before first use, AWS SSO-style configure flow
- [x] **CONF-02**: Domain name is configurable — SES email addresses (`{sandbox-id}@sandboxes.{domain}`), JSON Schema `$id` URL, `apiVersion` in profiles, and ConfigUI branding all derive from the configured domain, not hardcoded `klankermaker.ai`
- [x] **CONF-03**: AWS account numbers (management, terraform, application) and SSO start URL are configurable — referenced by Terragrunt hierarchy, IAM policies, and `km` CLI commands without hardcoding
- [x] **CONF-04**: `km init` or `km configure` command walks the operator through initial setup: domain, accounts, region, SSO — writes the config file and validates AWS access
- [x] **CONF-05**: `km shell <sandbox-id>` opens an interactive shell into a running sandbox — abstracts the substrate (EC2: SSM Session Manager, ECS: ECS Exec, future k8s: kubectl exec). Operator never needs to know the underlying AWS CLI incantation

### Budget Enforcement

- [x] **BUDG-01**: Per-sandbox budget with separate compute and AI spend pools defined in profile YAML (`spec.budget.compute.maxSpendUSD`, `spec.budget.ai.maxSpendUSD`)
- [x] **BUDG-02**: DynamoDB global table (single-table design, extending defcon.run.34 auth pattern) stores budget limits and running spend per sandbox, replicated to all regions where agents run for low-latency local reads
- [x] **BUDG-03**: Compute spend tracked as instance type spot rate × elapsed minutes (per-minute billing); rate sourced from AWS Price List API at sandbox creation
- [x] **BUDG-04**: AI/token spend tracked per Bedrock Anthropic model (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus); http-proxy sidecar intercepts `InvokeModel` responses, extracts `usage.input_tokens`/`usage.output_tokens`, multiplies by model rate, increments DynamoDB budget record
- [x] **BUDG-05**: Model pricing sourced from AWS Price List API (cached, refreshed daily) — supports all Anthropic models available on Bedrock
- [x] **BUDG-06**: At 80% budget threshold (configurable via `spec.budget.warningThreshold`), operator receives warning email via SES using existing `SendLifecycleNotification` pattern
- [x] **BUDG-07**: Dual-layer enforcement — at 100% AI budget, http-proxy returns 403 for Bedrock calls (immediate, real-time); the same EventBridge-triggered Lambda that checks compute spend also reads DynamoDB AI spend records and revokes the instance profile's Bedrock IAM permissions as a backstop (catches SDK/CLI calls that bypass the proxy); at 100% compute budget, Lambda suspends the sandbox: EC2 instances are stopped (`StopInstances` — preserves EBS, no compute charges, resumable on top-up); ECS Fargate tasks trigger artifact upload then stop (tasks are ephemeral — top-up re-provisions from stored profile in S3)
- [x] **BUDG-08**: Operator can top up a sandbox budget via `km budget add <sandbox-id> --compute <amount> --ai <amount>` which updates DynamoDB limits and resumes enforcement: for AI, restores Bedrock IAM and proxy unblocks; for compute, EC2 instances are started (`StartInstances` — resumes from stopped state), ECS Fargate tasks are re-provisioned from the stored profile in S3
- [x] **BUDG-09**: `km status <sandbox-id>` shows current spend vs budget for both compute and AI pools, including per-model AI breakdown
- [x] **BUDG-10**: AI/token spend tracked for Anthropic API (Claude Code) calls via `api.anthropic.com`; http-proxy sidecar intercepts `POST /v1/messages` responses (both non-streaming and SSE streaming), extracts `usage.input_tokens`/`usage.output_tokens`, prices against Anthropic's published model rates, and increments DynamoDB budget record using the same `IncrementAISpend` path as Bedrock metering

### Operator Experience

- [x] **OPER-01**: All terragrunt-calling CLI commands (`km create`, `km destroy`, `km init`, `km uninit`) suppress raw terragrunt/terraform output by default — show step-level summaries instead; `--verbose` flag restores full output streaming; errors and warnings always shown regardless of mode

### Operator Notification Hooks

- [x] **HOOK-01**: Compiler unconditionally writes `/opt/km/bin/km-notify-hook` bash script during user-data execution; script exists on every sandbox regardless of profile settings, and is gated at run-time by env vars
- [x] **HOOK-02**: Compiler merges `Notification` and `Stop` hook entries into `~/.claude/settings.json`, preserving any user-supplied entries from `spec.execution.configFiles` (parses existing JSON, appends km hook command, writes merged result; fails fast if user JSON is invalid)
- [x] **HOOK-03**: Compiler writes `/etc/profile.d/km-notify-env.sh` with `KM_NOTIFY_ON_PERMISSION` / `KM_NOTIFY_ON_IDLE` / `KM_NOTIFY_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` / `KM_NOTIFY_EMAIL` only when the corresponding `spec.cli.notify*` profile field is set; unset profile fields produce no env var
- [x] **HOOK-04**: `km shell` and `km agent run` honor `--notify-on-permission` / `--no-notify-on-permission` / `--notify-on-idle` / `--no-notify-on-idle` CLI flags, overriding profile defaults via env vars injected at SSM-launch time (interactive shell uses pre-session SendCommand to write `/etc/profile.d/zz-km-notify.sh`; agent run prepends `export KM_NOTIFY_ON_*=...` lines to the generated bash script)
- [x] **HOOK-05**: `/opt/km/bin/km-notify-hook` honors gate env vars, cooldown (`/tmp/km-notify.last`), builds correct subjects (`[<sandbox-id>] needs permission` / `[<sandbox-id>] idle`) and bodies (Notification: `.message` from stdin payload; Stop: last assistant text from `transcript_path` JSONL), calls `km-send --body <file>` (not stdin, per CLAUDE.md OpenSSL 3.5+ requirement), and never blocks Claude on send failure (always exits 0)

### Slack Notifications

- [x] **SLCK-01**: Profile schema gains five `spec.cli` fields — `notifyEmailEnabled` (*bool), `notifySlackEnabled` (*bool), `notifySlackPerSandbox` (bool), `notifySlackChannelOverride` (string, pattern `^C[A-Z0-9]+$`), `slackArchiveOnDestroy` (*bool); `ValidationError` gains `IsWarning bool` field; five semantic validation rules (mutual-exclusion error, two no-op warnings, channel-ID regex error, neither-channel warning); `km validate` prints warnings without failing
- **SLCK-02**: Compiler extends the inlined `km-notify-hook` heredoc in `pkg/compiler/userdata.go` for parallel email + Slack dispatch (sent_any pattern), adds `KM_NOTIFY_EMAIL_ENABLED`, `KM_NOTIFY_SLACK_ENABLED`, `KM_SLACK_CHANNEL_ID`, `KM_SLACK_BRIDGE_URL` to the `/etc/profile.d/km-notify-env.sh` template emitted via `NotifyEnv`; cooldown updates iff at least one channel succeeded; Phase 62 backward compat preserved (unset `notifyEmailEnabled` → no env var → hook default of `1` keeps email on)
- **SLCK-03**: `km-slack` Go binary at `/opt/km/bin/km-slack` (built via `cmd/km-slack/main.go`, deployed via the sidecar Makefile target + S3 upload, downloaded in user-data); signs canonical JSON envelope with sandbox Ed25519 key from `/sandbox/{id}/signing-key`, POSTs to `$KM_SLACK_BRIDGE_URL`, retries 3 attempts on 5xx/network with 1s/2s/4s backoff, refuses bodies >40 KB; `--body <file>` only (no stdin, OpenSSL 3.5+ constraint per CLAUDE.md)
- **SLCK-04**: `km-slack-bridge` Go Lambda with Function URL (auth=NONE, first publicly-addressable Lambda in this codebase); verifies Ed25519 signature using public key from DynamoDB `km-identities` table (NOT SSM — RESEARCH.md correction #1); enforces ±5-min timestamp window + nonce table `km-slack-bridge-nonces` (10-min TTL, conditional write); channel-mismatch authorization (sandbox `post` rejected if channel ≠ `slack_channel_id` in `km-sandboxes` DynamoDB); action authorization (`archive`/`test` only from operator); dispatches to Slack `chat.postMessage` / `conversations.archive`; returns 503 + Retry-After on Slack 429
- **SLCK-05**: `km slack init` operator command — interactive bootstrap that validates bot token via `auth.test`, writes SSM params `/km/slack/{bot-token,workspace,invite-email,shared-channel-id,bridge-url}`, creates `#km-notifications` shared channel, sends Slack Connect invite to invite-email, deploys bridge Lambda via Terraform apply; companion commands `km slack test` and `km slack status`
- **SLCK-06**: `km create` provisions Slack channel before user-data finalizes — shared mode reads `/km/slack/shared-channel-id`, per-sandbox mode calls `conversations.create` for `#sb-{id}` (with sanitized channel name) + `conversations.inviteShared`, override mode validates the channel exists; channel ID stored in DynamoDB `km-sandboxes.slack_channel_id` and injected into `/etc/profile.d/km-notify-env.sh` as `KM_SLACK_CHANNEL_ID`; failure during channel creation aborts `km create` and tears down partially-created infra
- **SLCK-07**: `km destroy` archive flow — for sandboxes provisioned with `notifySlackPerSandbox: true` and `slackArchiveOnDestroy != false`, posts a final "destroyed at <timestamp>" message and calls `conversations.archive` via the bridge Lambda using operator signing key; archive failure logs warning, does NOT block destroy; missing `/km/slack/bridge-url` skips the Slack archive entirely with a clear log line
- **SLCK-08**: `km doctor` adds two checks — `checkSlackTokenValidity` calls `auth.test` via the bridge Lambda using operator signing, returns WARN on invalid/expired token; `checkStaleSlackChannels` scans `km-sandboxes` for records with `slack_channel_id` whose sandbox no longer exists, returns WARN listing stale channels
- **SLCK-09**: End-to-end live verification — `test/e2e/slack/` harness gated by `RUN_SLACK_E2E=1`; covers shared-mode notification delivery, per-sandbox lifecycle + archive, Phase 62 email backward compat, Slack rate-limit propagation; bot token rotation and Slack Connect invite acceptance covered as documented UAT in `63-10-UAT.md`
- **SLCK-10**: Documentation — `docs/slack-notifications.md` operator guide (workspace prerequisites, `km slack init` walkthrough, profile field reference, troubleshooting matrix, security model, rotation procedures); `CLAUDE.md` updated with new commands (`km slack init/test/status`), env var conventions (`KM_NOTIFY_SLACK_ENABLED`, `KM_SLACK_CHANNEL_ID`, `KM_SLACK_BRIDGE_URL`, `KM_NOTIFY_EMAIL_ENABLED`), and SSM parameter convention (`/km/slack/*`)
- **SLCK-11**: `km create` step 11d runtime injection visibility — Lambda subprocess (`internal/app/cmd/create.go:790-825`) currently silences zerolog (`destroy.go:138`-style `log.Logger = zerolog.New(io.Discard)` in `create.go:189-193`), so all step 11d failure branches (bridge URL missing, terragrunt outputs read failure, instance ID missing, SSM SendCommand failure) discard their warnings. Each branch must emit a visible `fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, ...)` line — explicit success (`✓ Slack: channel C... wired into sandbox env`) AND each failure variant — so operators can diagnose why `KM_SLACK_CHANNEL_ID`/`KM_SLACK_BRIDGE_URL` aren't appearing in `/etc/profile.d/km-notify-env.sh` after `km create --remote`. Root cause of the silent failure must also be diagnosed and fixed (likely SSM SendCommand timing — agent may not be reachable when `runner.Output` returns).
- **SLCK-12**: `km destroy` Slack archive auto-trigger — `destroySlackChannel` (`internal/app/cmd/destroy_slack.go`) is invoked at `destroy.go:474` but the archive bridge call evidently doesn't reach Slack (verified during UAT 4b: direct `conversations.archive` returned `ok:true` after destroy completed, proving channel was NOT archived by destroy). Visible logging shipped in `377b588` — diagnose root cause from next-attempt stderr output and fix. Likely cause: final-post bridge call returns an error (Case H at `destroy_slack.go:106`) which skips the archive entirely; instrument WHY the final-post fails (operator key load? SSM access? Bridge URL mismatch?). End state: a `km destroy` of a per-sandbox sandbox with `slackArchiveOnDestroy != false` must archive the channel and emit `✓ Slack: archived channel C...` on stderr.
- **SLCK-13**: Bot-token rotation full E2E — UAT Scen 7 verified the idempotent path (`--force` reuses existing channel after `1ad765c`); the FULL rotation cycle remains unverified: revoke token in Slack App admin → wait for the bridge Lambda's `SSMBotTokenFetcher` 15-min cache TTL to elapse → reissue new token → `km slack init --force --bot-token <new>` → `km slack test` succeeds with the new token. Plan must include a documented operator runbook step + automated test where feasible (cache invalidation via Lambda cold-start trigger as a fallback to the 15-min wait).

### Slack Inbound (Bidirectional Chat — Phase 67)

- **REQ-SLACK-IN-SCHEMA**: Profile schema gains `spec.cli.notifySlackInboundEnabled` (bool, default false); validation rules: requires `notifySlackEnabled: true` AND `notifySlackPerSandbox: true`; rejects `notifySlackChannelOverride` set; default-false has no validation impact (Phase 67)
- **REQ-SLACK-IN-DDB**: New DynamoDB table `{prefix}-km-slack-threads` (PK=channel_id S, SK=thread_ts S; attrs claude_session_id, sandbox_id, last_turn_ts, turn_count, ttl_expiry; TTL 30 days via `ttl_expiry` Number attribute); new GSI `slack_channel_id-index` on `km-sandboxes` (additive, dynamodb-sandboxes module v1.1.0); Config struct gains SlackThreadsTableName field + GetSlackThreadsTableName helper + GetResourcePrefix fallback ("km") (Phase 67)
- **REQ-SLACK-IN-EVENTS**: Bridge Lambda gains `POST /events` route handling Slack Events API webhook; verifies HMAC-SHA256 signing secret from `/km/slack/signing-secret` SSM SecureString with ±5min timestamp window; echoes `url_verification` challenge before signature check; deduplicates `event_id` via existing km_slack_bridge_nonces table; bot-loop filter (event.bot_id, subtype bot_message/message_changed/message_deleted, event.user == cached bot user_id from auth.test) (Phase 67)
- **REQ-SLACK-IN-DELIVERY**: Bridge `/events` resolves channel→sandbox via slack_channel_id-index GSI on km-sandboxes; writes per-sandbox SQS FIFO message (MessageGroupId=sandbox-id, MessageDeduplicationId=event_id) carrying {channel, thread_ts, text, user, event_ts}; idempotently upserts km_slack_threads row keyed by (channel_id, thread_ts) with attribute_not_exists condition; returns 200 in <3s (Slack Events API requirement) (Phase 67)
- **REQ-SLACK-IN-POLLER**: Sandbox-side `/opt/km/bin/km-slack-inbound-poller` bash script + `/etc/systemd/system/km-slack-inbound-poller.service` systemd unit (inline heredoc in `pkg/compiler/userdata.go`, mirrors km-mail-poller); SQS long-poll (WaitTimeSeconds=20), ChangeMessageVisibility 300s before agent run, DDB GetItem for session lookup, claude -p --resume invocation, session_id capture from output.json, DDB PutItem write-back, DeleteMessage only on success; conditionally generated when `notifySlackInboundEnabled: true`; exports `KM_SLACK_THREAD_TS` env var consumed by Phase 63 km-notify-hook → km-slack post --thread (Phase 67)
- **REQ-SLACK-IN-LIFECYCLE**: `km create` provisions per-sandbox SQS FIFO queue `{prefix}-slack-inbound-{sandbox-id}.fifo` (14d retention, 30s VisibilityTimeout, ContentBasedDeduplication=false) before user-data finalization; URL stored in km-sandboxes DDB as `slack_inbound_queue_url`; injected as `KM_SLACK_INBOUND_QUEUE_URL` into `/etc/profile.d/km-notify-env.sh`; failure aborts km create with full rollback (channel + queue + infra); operator-signed "ready" announcement posted via existing bridge `post` action with its ts recorded in km_slack_threads; `km destroy` stops poller, drains in-flight up to 30s, posts final "destroyed" message, deletes SQS queue, deletes km_slack_threads rows for channel_id (Phase 67)
- **REQ-SLACK-IN-OBSERVABILITY**: `km status <sandbox-id>` adds queue URL, ApproximateNumberOfMessages, last-receive timestamp, active thread count; `km list --wide` adds column (active thread count); `km doctor --all-regions` adds three checks — `slack_inbound_queue_exists` (every notifySlackInboundEnabled sandbox has accessible queue), `slack_inbound_stale_queues` (`{prefix}-slack-inbound-*.fifo` queues without matching DDB sandbox row), `slack_app_events_subscription` (Events API URL configured + required scopes channels:history, groups:history) (Phase 67)
- **REQ-SLACK-IN-INIT**: `km slack init` extension — captures Slack signing secret (new prompt), persists to `/km/slack/signing-secret` SSM SecureString (KMS-encrypted, separate from existing `/km/slack/bot-token`); validates Events API URL points to bridge Function URL `/events` path; verifies bot has additional scopes channels:history + groups:history via auth.test diagnostic; documented manual operator runbook for signing-secret rotation (force Lambda cold-start) (Phase 67)

### eBPF Network Enforcement

- **EBPF-NET-01**: `pkg/ebpf/` package scaffold with bpf2go pipeline — `go generate` compiles BPF C programs, bpf2go generates Go loader code, `make build` embeds compiled bytecode in km binary
- **EBPF-NET-02**: BPF cgroup/connect4 program intercepts all `connect()` syscalls from sandbox cgroup; looks up destination IP in `BPF_MAP_TYPE_LPM_TRIE` allowlist; returns 0 (EPERM) for disallowed IPs, returns 1 (allow) for allowed IPs
- **EBPF-NET-03**: BPF cgroup/connect4 program rewrites destination IP/port for connections needing L7 inspection (GitHub, Bedrock endpoints) — redirects to `127.0.0.1:{proxy_port}`, stores original dest in hash map keyed by socket cookie (DNAT replacement without iptables)
- **EBPF-NET-04**: BPF cgroup/sendmsg4 program intercepts UDP port 53 DNS queries; redirects to km-dns-resolver daemon listening on localhost
- **EBPF-NET-05**: Userspace km-dns-resolver daemon receives redirected DNS queries, resolves domains, checks against profile allowlist (supports wildcards via suffix matching), returns NXDOMAIN for denied domains, pushes allowed resolved IPs into BPF LPM_TRIE map
- **EBPF-NET-06**: BPF cgroup_skb/egress program provides packet-level defense-in-depth — blocks packets to IPs not in the LPM_TRIE allowlist, catches raw socket traffic and hardcoded IPs that bypass connect()
- **EBPF-NET-07**: BPF ring buffer emits structured deny events to userspace — `{timestamp, pid, src_ip, dst_ip, dst_port, action, layer}` for audit logging
- **EBPF-NET-08**: All BPF programs and maps pinned to `/sys/fs/bpf/km/{sandbox-id}/` — enforcement persists after `km create` exits; `km destroy` unpins and detaches; reattach on restart via `LoadPinnedLink()`/`LoadPinnedMap()`
- **EBPF-NET-09**: Profile schema gains `spec.network.enforcement` field — `proxy` (current iptables DNAT), `ebpf` (pure eBPF), `both` (eBPF primary + proxy for L7); default is `proxy` for backwards compatibility
- **EBPF-NET-10**: TC egress classifier (best-effort) parses TLS ClientHello SNI from first TCP segment of port-443 connections; validates hostname against BPF hash map; passes traffic where SNI is not in first segment (no TCP reassembly — Chrome large ClientHellos may be segmented)
- **EBPF-NET-11**: Compiler emits eBPF enforcement setup in EC2 user-data when profile has `enforcement: ebpf | both` — starts km-dns-resolver daemon, attaches BPF programs to sandbox cgroup, populates initial allowlist from profile
- **EBPF-NET-12**: Root-in-sandbox bypass prevention verified — process with `CAP_NET_ADMIN` inside sandbox can flush iptables (irrelevant) but cannot connect to blocked IP (EPERM from cgroup/connect4); process cannot detach BPF programs (no `CAP_BPF` in host namespace)

### eBPF TLS Uprobe Observability

- **EBPF-TLS-01**: `pkg/ebpf/tls/` package with per-library probe modules — each module discovers library path, resolves symbol offsets, attaches uprobes/uretprobes via `link.OpenExecutable()`, reads plaintext via ring buffer
- **EBPF-TLS-02**: OpenSSL module hooks `SSL_write`/`SSL_write_ex` entry + `SSL_read`/`SSL_read_ex` entry+return on `libssl.so.3`; auto-detects OpenSSL version from `.rodata` for struct offset selection; handles OpenSSL 1.1.x and 3.x
- **EBPF-TLS-03**: GnuTLS module hooks `gnutls_record_send` entry + `gnutls_record_recv` entry+return on `libgnutls.so`
- **EBPF-TLS-04**: NSS module hooks `PR_Write`/`PR_Send` entry + `PR_Read`/`PR_Recv` entry+return on `libnspr4.so`
- **EBPF-TLS-05**: Go crypto/tls module hooks `crypto/tls.(*Conn).Write` and `(*Conn).Read` in target Go binaries — disassembles function to find all `RET` offsets via `golang.org/x/arch`, attaches uprobe at each RET instead of uretprobe; detects Go ABI version (stack vs register)
- **EBPF-TLS-06**: rustls module hooks `Writer::write` entry + `Reader::read` entry+return in Rust binaries — discovers symbols via ELF scan for `rustc` marker + `rustls` pattern matching on mangled v0 names; handles inverted read path
- **EBPF-TLS-07**: Connection correlation via kprobe on `connect()`/`accept()` populates `(pid, fd) → {remote_ip, remote_port}` BPF hash map; SSL hooks extract fd from library struct or connection map; ring buffer events include remote endpoint
- **EBPF-TLS-08**: Ring buffer events carry `{timestamp_ns, pid, tid, fd, remote_ip, remote_port, direction, library_type, payload_len, payload[≤16384 bytes]}` — 16KB aligned with TLS max fragment length
- **EBPF-TLS-09**: Userspace consumer reads ring buffer, reassembles HTTP request/response pairs, routes to registered handlers — budget metering handler extracts token counts using existing `ExtractBedrockTokens()`/`ExtractAnthropicTokens()`
- **EBPF-TLS-10**: Budget metering via uprobes replaces MITM proxy metering when tlsCapture is enabled — Bedrock and Anthropic response bodies parsed for token usage, routed through existing `IncrementAISpend()` DynamoDB path
- **EBPF-TLS-11**: Profile schema gains `spec.observability.tlsCapture` — `enabled` (bool), `libraries` (array of openssl/gnutls/nss/go/rustls/all), `capturePayloads` (bool, default false for metadata-only metering)
- **EBPF-TLS-12**: Library discovery at sandbox startup scans `/proc/<pid>/maps` for shared libraries and ELF headers of binaries; attaches probes to each discovered library/binary; logs which libraries instrumented
- **EBPF-TLS-13**: Per-library toggle via BPF map `(cgroup_id, library_type) → enabled`; userspace can enable/disable specific libraries without detaching probes; `km status` shows capture status
- **EBPF-TLS-14**: GitHub repo path extraction from captured HTTPS plaintext — HTTP request paths parsed to extract `owner/repo`; compared against profile allowedRepos; violations logged to audit trail

- **PLAT-04**: Multi-cloud support (GCP, Azure)

### Sandbox Identity Customization

- **PREFIX-01**: Profile schema supports optional `metadata.prefix` field with validation (`^[a-z][a-z0-9]{0,11}$`)
- **PREFIX-02**: `GenerateSandboxID()` accepts a prefix parameter — generates `{prefix}-{8 hex}` IDs
- **PREFIX-03**: All sandbox ID validation/matching patterns accept any valid prefix, not just `sb-`
- **PREFIX-04**: Compiler, CLI, and Lambda code use sandbox ID as-is — no component hardcodes the `sb-` prefix
- **PREFIX-05**: Backwards compatible — profiles without `metadata.prefix` default to `sb`
- **ALIAS-01**: `km create --alias <name>` stores alias in S3 metadata.json; all commands resolve alias to sandbox ID via S3 scan
- **ALIAS-02**: Profile-level `metadata.alias` template auto-generates `{alias}-1`, `{alias}-2` etc. by scanning active sandboxes
- **ALIAS-03**: `--alias` flag overrides profile-level template; alias freed on destroy for reuse
- **ALIAS-04**: `km list` displays alias column; `ResolveSandboxRef` resolves aliases (future: DynamoDB index for O(1) lookup)

### Advanced Policy

- **PLCY-01**: OPA / policy engine integration for enterprise compliance
- **PLCY-02**: Multi-tenancy with RBAC and session ownership

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Docker/local substrate | Development convenience only; adds complexity without isolation guarantees; v2 candidate |
| Kubernetes substrate (k8s/EKS) | EC2 and ECS cover v1 use cases; k8s is a near-future v2 extension (PLAT-01) |
| Multi-cloud implementation | Schema is cloud-neutral but v1 implements AWS only |
| Full OPA policy engine | YAML allowlists cover 90% of use cases; OPA adds operator complexity |
| Real-time collaboration / multi-user editing | Single-operator model for v1; multi-tenancy is a major scope increase |
| Interactive terminal / SSH into sandboxes | Creates "pet server" behavior; conflicts with ephemeral destroy-on-TTL model |
| Deny-list network policy | Allowlists are more auditable and secure; deny-lists are incomplete by definition |
| Mobile app | Web ConfigUI is sufficient |

## Phase 84.2 — Synthetic IDs (phase-local)

These IDs are phase-local and synthetic — they derive from the Phase 84.2 design spec
(docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-16-km-init-plan-flag-and-destroy-class-gate-design.md) rather than
the formal v1/v2 requirement process. Recorded here for plan-checker traceability.

| ID | Description |
|----|-------------|
| DESTROY-CLASS-GATE | Curated compiled-in ProtectedTypes gate that halts km init --plan on protected destroys/replaces |
| PROTECTED-TYPES-LIST | The ProtectedTypes list in protected.go with 10 entries (including aws_ses_receipt_rule) |
| ACCEPT-DESTROYS-OVERRIDE | --i-accept-destroys flag that clears exit code to 0 without applying; trips still printed |
| PLAN-FLAG | --plan flag on km init and km bootstrap --shared-ses; independent of --dry-run; never applies |
| BOOTSTRAP-PLAN-PARITY | km bootstrap --shared-ses --plan runs the same destroy-class gate as km init --plan |
| PLAN-OUTPUT-FORMAT | Per-module one-line summary + trip block always full + override notice + aggregate footer |
| PLAN-ERROR-HANDLING | Hard-stop on plan failure; conservative-trip on parse/show failure; gate result as exit code |

## Phase 84.3 — Synthetic IDs (phase-local, gap-closure)

These IDs are phase-local and synthetic — they derive from the Phase 84.3 wrapper-level UX gap-closure
work (plans 84.3-06 through 84.3-09) and the UAT re-verification (plan 84.3-10). Recorded here for
plan-checker traceability.

| ID | Description | Status |
|----|-------------|--------|
| ENV-CONFIG-DRIFT-WARN | Drift WARN fires for env-bound keys (KM_REGION, KM_ARTIFACTS_BUCKET, etc.) via YAMLDefaults snapshot in config.Load(); also fires on default km bootstrap path (runBootstrap) — gap closure 84.3-07 + 84.3-08 | Complete (gap closure 84.3-07, 84.3-08) |
| ARTIFACTS-BUCKET-DERIVATION | Placeholder artifacts_bucket values (literal km-artifacts-12345 and angle-bracket forms) rejected at config.Load() time; validateArtifactsBucket wired into Load() — gap closure 84.3-09 | Complete (gap closure 84.3-09) |
| BOOTSTRAP-WORKFLOW-DISCOVERABILITY | km init --plan hard-fails on placeholder artifacts_bucket (via config.Load); --all flag chains foundation + shared SES; Next steps header in yaml and finale to stdout — f.6 init hard-fail PASS; f.4/f.5/f.7 remain DEFERRED to operator | Complete — f.6 hard-fail PASS (gap closure 84.3-09); operator follow-up for f.4/f.5/f.7 |
| CONFIG-DISPLAY-VS-YAML-AUTHORITY | Drift WARN fires on all bootstrap paths (runBootstrap + runBootstrapSharedSES); yaml-authoritative keys win over env overrides; empty-yaml emits banner WARN — gap closure 84.3-08 | Complete — drift WARN fires on all bootstrap paths (gap closure 84.3-08) |

*Last updated: 2026-05-17 — Phase 84.3 synthetic IDs added; all 4 gap-closure requirements marked Complete*

## Phase 89 — Synthetic IDs (phase-local)

These IDs are phase-local and synthetic — they derive from the Phase 89 design
(CONTEXT.md decisions + RESEARCH.md proposed mint) for the SOPS secret injection
feature. Phase 89 has no formal v1/v2 requirement IDs in ROADMAP.md (entry was
"TBD"); these IDs are recorded here for plan-checker traceability following the
Phase 84.2/84.3 pattern.

| ID | Description | Status |
|----|-------------|--------|
| SOPS-01-SCHEMA | `spec.secrets.sopsFile` parses, defaults empty; `SecretsSpec` struct added to `Spec` in `pkg/profile/types.go` | Planned |
| SOPS-02-VALIDATION | `km validate` rejects missing `.enc.yaml` suffix and requires `sops:` metadata block; runs offline (no KMS calls) | Planned |
| SOPS-03-KMS-MODULE | `infra/modules/sandbox-secrets-key/v1.0.0/` (aws_kms_key + alias + key policy + prevent_destroy + enable_key_rotation); `terraform validate` passes | Planned |
| SOPS-04-MODULE-WIRING | `infra/live/use1/sandbox-secrets-key/terragrunt.hcl` mirrors ses-shared-rule-set; `terragrunt plan` clean | Planned |
| SOPS-05-BOOTSTRAP-FLAG | `km bootstrap --shared-secrets-key` flag mirrors `--shared-ses`; new `runBootstrapSharedSecretsKey` function with test seam | Planned |
| SOPS-06-BOOTSTRAP-PLAN | `--shared-secrets-key --plan` evaluates Phase 84.2 destroy-class gate (`aws_kms_key` already in ProtectedTypes) | Planned |
| SOPS-07-BOOTSTRAP-ALL-CHAIN | `km bootstrap --all` chains foundation → shared-ses → shared-secrets-key; mutex with `--shared-secrets-key` | Planned |
| SOPS-08-IAM-OPERATOR | No-op verify — operator IAM already grants `kms:*` (km-operator-policy/v1.0.0/main.tf:484) | Planned |
| SOPS-09-IAM-SANDBOX | `infra/modules/ec2spot/v1.2.0/main.tf` emits `kms:Decrypt` with `kms:ResourceAliases` condition + S3 GetObject scoped to own sandbox bundle | Planned |
| SOPS-10-SCHEMA-EXPORT | JSON Schema (`pkg/profile/schemas/sandbox_profile.schema.json`) gains `spec.secrets` object schema with `sopsFile` string property | Planned |
| SOPS-11-COMPILER-UPLOAD | `create.go` uploads bundle bytes to `s3://${prefix}-artifacts-*/sandboxes/<id>/secrets.enc.yaml` in pre-terragrunt-apply step | Planned |
| SOPS-12-USERDATA-FETCH | userdata template emits `aws s3 cp` of sops binary + bundle iff `SopsBundlePresent`; gated block after section 5 sidecar download | Planned |
| SOPS-13-USERDATA-DECRYPT | Decrypt uses `sops decrypt --output-type dotenv > /etc/sandbox-secrets.env`; ownership root:root mode 0400 | Planned |
| SOPS-14-USERDATA-ENV-EXPOSURE | `/etc/profile.d/zz-sandbox-secrets.sh` uses `set -a` / `. file` / `set +a` to export dotenv keys to login shells | Planned |
| SOPS-15-BOOT-FAIL-ABORT | Decrypt failure path emits `exit 1` in user-data so sandbox enters failed state (hard-abort, not fail-open) | Planned |
| SOPS-16-DESTROY-CLEANUP | `destroy.go` deletes bundle S3 object (non-fatal on missing — idempotent; S3 lifecycle is belt-and-suspenders) | Planned |
| SOPS-17-S3-LIFECYCLE | `infra/modules/s3-artifacts-lifecycle/v1.1.0/main.tf` adds 7-day expiration rule for `sandboxes/` prefix | Planned |
| SOPS-18-DOCTOR-CHECK | `checkSharedSecretsKey` returns OK / WARN(missing) / WARN(orphans); mirrors `checkSESRules` orphan-WARN | Planned |
| SOPS-19-CONFIGURE-GITIGNORE | `km configure` idempotently appends `/secrets/*` + `!/secrets/*.enc.yaml` to `.gitignore` | Planned |
| SOPS-20-SIDECARS-SOPS-DEPLOY | `km init --sidecars` downloads sops v3.13.1 linux/amd64 and uploads to `s3://${bucket}/binaries/sops` | Planned |
| SOPS-21-UNINIT-CLEANUP | `km uninit` deletes own-prefix alias + schedule-deletes own key only; preserves sibling-install KMS resources | Planned |
| SOPS-22-DOCS | `docs/sandbox-secrets.md` operator guide + CLAUDE.md "Where to look" entry + OPERATOR-GUIDE.md section | Planned |
| SOPS-23-UAT-ACCEPTANCE | Live: Codex sandbox with `spec.secrets.sopsFile: ./secrets/codex.enc.yaml` accrues `BUDGET#ai#gpt-*` via sops-injected `OPENAI_API_KEY` (no operator post-create wiring) | Planned |

---

*Last updated: 2026-05-26 — Phase 89 synthetic IDs added for plan-checker traceability (23 IDs covering schema, KMS module, bootstrap CLI, compiler/userdata, lifecycle, doctor, sidecar deploy, docs, UAT)*

---

## Phase 93 — Synthetic IDs (phase-local)

These IDs are phase-local and synthetic — they derive from the Phase 93 design
spec (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-02-km-desktop-remote-browser-design.md`)
and `93-CONTEXT.md`. Phase 93's ROADMAP entry recorded "Requirements: TBD"; these
IDs are minted here for plan-checker traceability following the Phase 84.2/84.3/89
pattern. Feature: `km desktop` — KasmVNC-backed browser/XFCE remote session.

| ID | Description | Status |
|----|-------------|--------|
| DSK-01-SCHEMA | `spec.runtime.desktop` block added to `pkg/profile/types.go` (`RuntimeDesktopSpec`: `enabled *bool`, `mode string`, `browsers []string`, `geometry string`), sibling to `RuntimeVSCodeSpec` | Planned |
| DSK-02-HELPER | `IsDesktopEnabled(*RuntimeDesktopSpec) bool` helper, defaulting **false** (nil block or nil `enabled` → false) — opposite of `IsVSCodeEnabled` | Planned |
| DSK-03-VALIDATE | `km validate` rules: `mode` ∈ {kiosk,full}; `browsers` ⊆ {firefox,chromium,chrome,brave}; `browsers` non-empty when `mode: kiosk`; `geometry` matches `^[0-9]+x[0-9]+$`; non-Ubuntu AMI guard when desktop enabled | Planned |
| DSK-04-SCHEMA-EXPORT | JSON Schema (`pkg/profile/schemas/…`) + `schema_export.go` gain the `spec.runtime.desktop` object schema | Planned |
| DSK-05-COMPILER-THREAD | Compiler threads `DesktopEnabled`/`DesktopMode`/`DesktopBrowsers`/`DesktopGeometry`/`DesktopKasmCredential` through `service_hcl.go` config (mirrors `VSCodeSSHPubKey`/`VSCodeEnabled`) | Planned |
| DSK-06-USERDATA-INSTALL | Idempotent userdata block gated by `{{- if .DesktopEnabled }}`: install KasmVNC `.deb` + matchbox-wm (kiosk)/XFCE (full) + selected browsers + fonts/dbus **only if absent** (AMI-bakeable skip) | Planned |
| DSK-07-USERDATA-SESSION | userdata seeds `~/.vnc/xstartup` (kiosk: matchbox + `browsers[0]` maximized; full: `exec startxfce4`), `~/.vnc/kasmvnc.yaml` (SSL off, clipboard on, geometry), enables systemd unit, binds loopback | Planned |
| DSK-08-CREDENTIAL | Per-sandbox KasmVNC credential generated at `km create`, stored at `~/.km/desktop/<id>`, threaded into compiler config, seeded into `~/.kasmpasswd` fresh at boot, **never baked** | Planned |
| DSK-09-CLI-START | `km desktop start <id> [--local-port 8444]`: local-port probe → fetch DDB → instance/region → SSM pre-flight (KasmVNC active) → print `https://localhost:PORT/` + credential → blocking SSM port-forward | Planned |
| DSK-10-CLI-STATUS | `km desktop status <id>`: one-round-trip SSM probe of the KasmVNC unit, one-line health summary, non-zero exit when unhealthy (mirrors `parseVSCodeStatus`) | Planned |
| DSK-11-SECURITY | KasmVNC + session bind 127.0.0.1 only; SSL disabled justified by loopback + encrypted SSM tunnel; SSM port-forward is sole ingress; per-sandbox credential defense-in-depth | Planned |
| DSK-12-PROFILE-EXAMPLE | `profiles/desktop.yaml` (kiosk-Firefox example) added and wired into `scripts/validate-all-profiles.sh` | Planned |
| DSK-13-SKILL | `klanker:desktop` user-invocable skill added alongside `klanker:vscode`; `plugin.json` + `marketplace.json` version bumped in lockstep | Planned |
| DSK-14-DOCS | `docs/desktop.md` runbook + `CLAUDE.md` "Where to look" row/section + `OPERATOR-GUIDE.md` section | Planned |
| DSK-15-TESTS | Profile validate tests, compiler userdata tests (mirroring `TestUserDataVSCode*`: kiosk/full xstartup, credential seed, loopback bind, disabled-emits-nothing, missing-credential errors, idempotent guard), `desktop_test.go` (port-in-use, pre-flight parse, status, start prints URL+credential) | Planned |

## Phase 94 — Synthetic IDs (phase-local)

These IDs are phase-local and synthetic — they derive from the Phase 94 design
spec (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-04-km-doctor-debris-cleanup-design.md`),
`94-CONTEXT.md`, and the `94-VALIDATION.md` per-task map (DBG-* labels). Phase 94's
ROADMAP entry recorded "Requirements: TBD"; these IDs are minted here for
plan-checker traceability following the Phase 84.2/84.3/89/93 pattern. Feature:
`km doctor` leaked per-sandbox debris cleanup (log groups, DDB rows, S3 lifecycle).

| ID | Description | Status |
|----|-------------|--------|
| DBG-INFRA | Three mocked-API interfaces (`CWLogsCleanupAPI`, `DDBScanDeleteAPI`, `S3LifecycleAPI`) + `DoctorDeps` client/bool fields + `initRealDepsWithExisting` wiring | Planned |
| DBG-CFG | Config knobs `doctor_log_retention_days` / `doctor_s3_expire_days` via the five-touchpoint pattern (incl. merge-list) + `DoctorConfigProvider` accessors + clamp | Planned |
| DBG-FLAGS | `--delete-logs` / `--delete-ddb-rows` / `--set-log-retention` / `--set-s3-lifecycle` flags threaded through `runDoctor`; `--with-deletes` fans out to the two delete flags | Planned |
| DBG-LOGS | `checkStaleLogGroups` enumerates all FOUR log-group families (budget-enforcer, github-token-refresher, `/km/sandboxes/`, `/km/sidecars/`), orphan→WARN, `--delete-logs` reclaims | Planned |
| DBG-LOGS-PREFIX | Lambda families matched on LITERAL `km-` prefix (not dynamic `resource_prefix`) — fixes the non-default-prefix leak | Planned |
| DBG-LOGS-RET | `--set-log-retention` idempotently sets `retentionInDays` on management + sandbox groups lacking it; management groups never deleted | Planned |
| DBG-DDB | `checkOrphanedDDBRows` scans four tables (budgets/identities/slack-threads/sandboxes), orphan→WARN, `--delete-ddb-rows` reclaims | Planned |
| DBG-DDB-AI | `BUDGET#ai#{modelID}` rows preserved unconditionally (regression guard) | Planned |
| DBG-DDB-GUARD | `sandboxes` rows purged only when `status` ∈ {failed,nocap}; in-flight `starting` and other statuses skipped | Planned |
| DBG-DDB-SLACK | `slack-threads` orphans resolved via non-key `sandbox_id` attribute; rows missing it are skipped | Planned |
| DBG-S3 | `checkS3LifecyclePolicy` WARNs when no expiry rule covers transient prefixes (`logs/`, `remote-create/`, `agent-runs/`, `slack-inbound/`) | Planned |
| DBG-S3-SET | `--set-s3-lifecycle` installs transient-only expiry rules, preserves existing/unrelated rules, never touches build-artifact prefixes, idempotent | Planned |
| DBG-PAGE | Full pagination on `DescribeLogGroups` (NextToken) and DynamoDB `Scan` (LastEvaluatedKey) | Planned |
| DBG-MULTI | `--ignore-prefix` / `doctor_ignore_prefixes` + active-set diff isolate sibling installs | Planned |
| DBG-SRCFIX | Root-cause prefix fix: per-sandbox log groups CREATED with dynamic `{resource_prefix}` (not hardcoded `km-`/`/km/`) in budget-enforcer/github-token/create-handler TF modules + userdata.go/service_hcl.go, so teardown matches on non-default installs; byte-identical compiled output on the default `km` install; `checkStaleLogGroups` matches both legacy and new names | Planned |
| DBG-UAT | Live reclamation against the `kph` install (manual; requires real AWS account) | Planned |

---

## Phase 95 — Synthetic IDs (phase-local)

These IDs are phase-local and synthetic — they derive from the Phase 95 design
spec (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-05-slack-federated-bridge-relay-design.md`)
and the Phase 95 ROADMAP entry's success criteria. The ROADMAP entry recorded
these IDs directly (SLACK-FED-*); they are minted here for plan-checker
traceability following the Phase 84.2/84.3/89/93/94 pattern. Feature: one Slack
App serving many `resource_prefix` installs/operators in one AWS account via a
static per-install `slack.peer_bridges` list + single-hop broadcast-on-miss relay.

| ID | Description | Status |
|----|-------------|--------|
| SLACK-FED-CFG | `slack.peer_bridges []string` in `km-config.yaml`: `SlackConfig.PeerBridges` struct field, v2→v merge-list entry, tri-state population from `v.GetStringSlice`; absent ⇒ nil ⇒ federation off | Planned |
| SLACK-FED-PLUMB | `init.go` exports `KM_SLACK_PEER_BRIDGES` (comma-joined) when set, with env-wins drift WARN; terragrunt.hcl `get_env` → TF `slack_peer_bridges` var → Lambda `KM_SLACK_PEER_BRIDGES` env; bridge parses env into peer URL slice | Planned |
| SLACK-FED-RELAY | `PeerRelayer`/`HTTPPeerRelayer` (`pkg/slack/bridge/relayer.go`) broadcasts verbatim body + `X-Slack-Signature` + `X-Slack-Request-Timestamp` + `X-KM-Relayed:1` to all peers in parallel, bounded context (~2.5s), synchronous before 200; failing peer logged non-fatal; injected into `EventsHandler` (nil ⇒ off) | Planned |
| SLACK-FED-LOOP | Decision table at the `FetchByChannel` miss site: {relayed?, hit?} → {process, broadcast, drop}; relayed request is terminal (processed-if-owned else dropped `slack_relay_no_owner`), NEVER re-relayed; loop structurally impossible | Planned |
| SLACK-FED-VERIFY | A relayed request passes the peer's `verifySlackSignature` with the shared signing secret (forwarded body+timestamp unchanged, ±5-min window); peer's normal `/events` path takes over unchanged | Planned |
| SLACK-FED-DOCTOR | `km doctor` WARNs on malformed `peer_bridges` URL, self-loop (URL == own bridge), and empty `peer_bridges` on the Slack Request-URL host install | Planned |
| SLACK-FED-E2E | Two installs in one account/region: message in install B's per-sandbox channel delivered to install A's bridge is relayed to + processed by install B (B's SQS enqueue + 👀); correctness invariant = channel-name uniqueness across installs | Planned |
| SLACK-FED-UAT | Live cross-install relay with one real Slack App + two installs (manual; requires real AWS + Slack) | Planned |

## Phase 96 — Synthetic IDs (phase-local)

These IDs are phase-local and synthetic — they derive from the Phase 96 design
spec (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-05-slack-default-router-design.md`) and the
Phase 96 ROADMAP entry's success criteria (SLACK-RTR-*). Feature: a default-router
install that replies helpfully to @-mentions in orphan channels, built on a
claim-aware scatter-gather upgrade of the Phase 95 relay.

| ID | Description | Status |
|----|-------------|--------|
| SLACK-RTR-CFG | `slack.default_router *bool` in `km-config.yaml`: `SlackConfig.DefaultRouter` struct field, v2→v merge-list entry, tri-state population; absent/false ⇒ router off (Phase 95 behavior) | Planned |
| SLACK-RTR-GATHER | Relay upgraded to a claim-aware scatter-gather: relayed-request handler returns `200 {claimed:bool, channels:[…]}`; non-owner peer returns its running sandbox channels (`km-sandboxes` `state=running` + `slack_channel_id`); front door parses + tallies; legacy `"ok"`/HTTP-error ⇒ treated as `claimed:true` | Planned |
| SLACK-RTR-ORPHAN | True-orphan detection: front-door `FetchByChannel` miss + zero peer claims ⇒ orphan; any claim ⇒ owner handled, no router action | Planned |
| SLACK-RTR-REPLY | On orphan + bot-mention + member channel + `default_router:true`: post exactly one threaded reply listing running sandbox channels aggregated across front door + all peers as `<#CID>` mentions (guidance-only when list empty); plumbed `KM_SLACK_DEFAULT_ROUTER` env (mirrors mention_only) | Planned |
| SLACK-RTR-COOLDOWN | Per-channel cooldown (reuse pause-hint mechanism, default 3600s): one reply per window, not per mention | Planned |
| SLACK-RTR-SAFE | `default_router` defaults false ⇒ byte-identical to Phase 95; non-mention messages and the bot's own reply never trigger the router (existing self-message/bot-loop filter); config drift WARN on `KM_SLACK_DEFAULT_ROUTER` | Planned |
| SLACK-RTR-E2E | Two installs + one Slack App: @-mention in an unowned member channel ⇒ one threaded reply listing both installs' running channels; repeat within cooldown ⇒ no second reply; owned channel ⇒ no router reply (manual; real AWS + Slack) | Planned |

## Phase 97 — Synthetic IDs (phase-local)

These IDs are phase-local and synthetic — they derive from the Phase 97 design
spec (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-06-github-app-bridge-pr-review-design.md`) and
the Phase 97 ROADMAP entry's success criteria. Feature: comment-triggered GitHub
App bridge that dispatches @-mention PR/issue comments to an aliased per-repo
sandbox (create-if-cold) where the agent reviews and posts back via a `km-github`
helper — the GitHub-shaped twin of the Slack inbound path.

| ID | Description | Status |
|----|-------------|--------|
| GH-APP-SCOPE | Extend existing `klanker-maker` GitHub App: add `issues`/`pull_requests`/`contents`/`checks` write scopes + `issue_comment` webhook subscription; `km github manifest` renders the manifest; webhook secret/bot-login/bridge-url stored at `/km/config/github/*` | Planned |
| GH-BRIDGE-VERIFY | `km-github-bridge` Lambda verifies `X-Hub-Signature-256` = HMAC-SHA256 over the **raw body** (constant-time compare) before parsing; rejects bad/absent signatures; reuses `pkg/github/token.go` for installation-token mint | Planned |
| GH-BRIDGE-AUTH | Loop guard (`action==created`, drop `comment.user.type==Bot`/self), `X-GitHub-Delivery` GUID dedupe via nonces table, bot-login mention detection, deny-by-default per-repo login allowlist (non-allowlisted ⇒ silent ignore) | Planned |
| GH-BRIDGE-ROUTE | Resolve `owner/repo → {alias, profile}` from `github.repos:` (exact-before-glob, alias defaults `gh-{owner}-{repo}`, profile falls back to `default_profile`); lookup via `alias-index` GSI; warm ⇒ enqueue `github-inbound` FIFO, cold ⇒ `SandboxCreate` EventBridge carrying pending prompt (Phase 86 prompt-queue); 👀 reaction + 200 within ack window | Planned |
| GH-INBOUND-Q | `spec.notification.github.inbound.enabled *bool` profile field; `km create` provisions per-sandbox `github-inbound` FIFO + `km-sandboxes.github_inbound_queue_url` + SSM `{prefix}sandbox/{id}/github-inbound-queue-url` + `KM_GITHUB_INBOUND_QUEUE_URL` env; absent/false ⇒ zero artifacts; destroy cleans up (clone of slack-inbound provisioning) | Planned |
| GH-POLLER | Sandbox-side inbound poller made source-aware: drains the `github-inbound` queue, builds a GitHub context preamble (repo/PR/branch/head + worktree-per-PR guidance) from the `{source:github,…}` envelope, dispatches to the configured agent via the tmux agent-run path | Planned |
| GH-HELPER | `km-github` sandbox-side helper using the per-sandbox installation token (SSM `{prefix}sandbox/{id}/github-token`, write-scoped via `generateAndStoreGitHubToken`): `comment` (issue/PR comment, `--reply-to`) and `review` (`POST .../pulls/{n}/reviews`, event APPROVE/COMMENT/REQUEST_CHANGES) verbs | Planned |
| GH-PROFILE | Lean built-in `github-review` SandboxProfile (per-repo, spot t3.medium, `teardownPolicy: stop`, `sourceAccess.github`, proxy enforcement, `notification.github.inbound.enabled: true`); validates via `km validate` | Planned |
| GH-CLI | `km github init` (generate/store webhook-secret, cache bot-login, record bridge-url), `km github manifest`, `km github status`; `github.repos:` round-trips config load (v2→v merge-list) and `km init` exports it to the bridge Lambda env with env-wins drift WARN | Planned |
| GH-DOCTOR | `km doctor` GitHub bridge checks: App configured, webhook secret present, bot-login cached, bridge URL set, per-repo alias/profile resolvability + match-overlap warnings | Planned |
| GH-E2E | `@klanker-maker review this PR` on a real PR ⇒ 👀 reaction within ack window ⇒ Claude runs in the per-repo sandbox (warm + cold-create paths) ⇒ PR review comment posted by the bot via `km-github review` (manual; real AWS + GitHub) | Planned |

## Phase 98 — Synthetic IDs (phase-local)

These IDs are phase-local and synthetic — they derive from the Phase 97/98 design
spec (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-06-github-app-bridge-pr-review-design.md`) and
the Phase 98 ROADMAP entry's success criteria. Feature: richer `km-github`
write-backs, thread/session continuity, and shared-alias across repos — the
expansion of the Phase 97 comment-trigger MVP.

| ID | Description | Status |
|----|-------------|--------|
| GH-X-CHECK | `km-github check` posts a check run (name + conclusion success/failure/neutral + summary) on the PR | Planned |
| GH-X-PRCREATE | `km-github pr create` opens a PR from a new branch (`--title/--base/--head/--body`) and returns its URL | Planned |
| GH-X-PUSH | Push-commit path hardened end-to-end (App write scopes from Phase 97); worktree-per-PR commit/push verified | Planned |
| GH-X-CONTINUITY | `(repo, number) → {sandbox_id, agent_session_id}` mapping (generalize `km-slack-threads` or sibling `km-github-threads`) so follow-up @-mentions in the same PR/issue continue the same agent session | Planned |
| GH-X-THREADBYPASS | Replies in a known PR/issue thread dispatch without requiring a re-@-mention (mirrors Phase 91.3 thread-bypass) | Planned |
| GH-X-SHARED | Multiple `github.repos:` entries may point at one shared alias (single larger sandbox), with worktree-per-PR isolation; `km doctor` warns on match overlap / alias collisions | Planned |
| GH-X-RESUME | Warm-path alias lookup that finds a `stopped`/`paused` sandbox auto-resumes it (bridge gains resume IAM, e.g. `ec2:StartInstances`); request is enqueued and drained after boot, respecting the ~10s ack window; enables "configure-once, stop, GitHub wakes it" workflow. (Phase 97 today: warm path is status-agnostic — enqueues to the stopped box and nothing drains it; cold path never fires because the stopped row holds the alias.) | Planned |
| GH-COLD-CREATE | Fix the broken cold-create path (Phase 97: implemented but never exercised — bridge `SandboxCreate` omits `sandbox_id`+`artifact_bucket`, malformed `artifact_prefix`, so `create-handler` rejects). Bridge generates valid `sandbox_id` + correct artifact bucket/prefix; `km init` pre-stages each `github.repos` profile to S3 (`{bucket}/{prefix}/.km-profile.yaml`) so `create-handler` can fetch it; cold-box auth via **SOPS-injected Claude creds** (`spec.secrets.sopsFile`, Phase 89 — not Bedrock) so a fresh box self-authenticates and posts; dispatch unified with GH-X-RESUME (resume if paused/stopped, cold-create only if truly absent). | Planned |
| GH-X-E2E | Follow-up @-mention continues the session; check run + opened PR visible; shared-alias dispatch across two repos to one sandbox; stopped-alias @-mention auto-resumes and processes (manual; real AWS + GitHub) | Planned |
